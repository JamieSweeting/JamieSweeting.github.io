            <p class="lead-para"> 
                For my main module for the duration of my third year at university, 
                I was a programmer for a isometric, ability-based, twin-stick 
                shooter. My main contributions included creating all 3 playable 
                characters and enemy types, along with many of their abilities, 
                as well as the gameplay camera system. I also created interactable 
                items and barriers for the level designers to place throughout the 
                level.
            </p> 
            <p>
                Being my first major project in Unreal Engine 5, there was a steep 
                learning curve and many mistakes made early on. After some initial rough months, 
                and a last minute participation in an UE5-based project for Global Game Jam 2025, 
                I quickly gained vital experience which proved useful in the last few sprints of
                the project.

            <h1 class="my-heading">Timeline</h1> 
            <p class="lead-para">
                The project followed the industry-standard production phase as closely as possible, 
                and took full advantage of agile workflow and verion control.
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Pre-Production (Oct 2024 - Dec 2024)</b><br>
                        The team spent the ideation phase concepting potential ideas for the type of game we wanted to make. 
                        We eventually decided on a co-op, twin-stick, isometric shooter with mechanics loosely inspired from an 
                        unconventional variety of games such as the perspective of Hades, with multiplayer/
                        couch co-op aspects of the Lego game franchises just to name a few. With this in mind, 
                        I created the initial prototype in Unity with help from the other programmer on the team, 
                        which was when we decided between ourselves that I would handle the character controls and 
                        he would work almost solely on enemy AI. <br>
                        This prototype proved a suitable proof of concept on which to base the rest of development, 
                        and it was also around this time that we decided to indefinitely shelf the co-op idea until 
                        we had more of the core mechanics in place.

                    <li><b>Production (Jan 2025 - May 2025)</b><br>
                        Being my first major project in Unreal Engine 5, there was a steep 
                        learning curve and many mistakes made early on. Particularly where performance and UI were concerned, 
                        there were definitely areas in which I needed rapid improvement if I wanted to help fulfill the vision 
                        myself and the team shared. After some initial rough months, 
                        and a last minute participation in an UE5-based project for Global Game Jam 2025, 
                        I quickly gained vital experience which proved useful in the last few sprints of
                        the project. Around halfway through, we decided it would be best to put all of our resources into 
                        making one high quality introductory level, as we could not guarantee a high standard of quality if we 
                        split our time between the initial two levels planned.

                    <li><b>Post-Production (May 2025)</b><br>
                        While development on new features and mechanics slowed down, I spent the last few weeks refining and 
                        optimising pre-existing systems, along with fixing critical bugs and errors.

            <p class="lead-para"> 
                After spending so much time on this project, I intend to continue working on it past the deadline for 'release', 
                returning to some of the earlier goals for the game as well as new ideas to build it into a more complete experience.
